### **Information**

<h3>Background</h3>

This application is designed to visualize the results of our family's contest where we each predict the winner of every game in the 2020 NFL season.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

The [Home](#section-home) page provides the current standings. Each game outcome that a family member predicts correctly is worth one point. Ties are worth a half point and losses are worth no points.

The [Picks](#section-picks) page lists every game by week and includes the outcome of the game along with each family member's prediction.

The [Teams](#section-teams) page provides some information on each team in the NFL.
